//Exercise 11
If you're going to be spending a lot of time debugging a single
problem, or if you're not comfortable with command-line tools, you can
try `node-inspector`. It's much more heavyweight and slower to start
than using the built-in debugger, so it's not as convenient if you're
jumping in and out of a test case many times a minute.

On the other hand, if you're familiar with Chrome's Dev Tools
interface, you'll feel right at home, because node-inspector uses
the Dev Tools UI to drive the V8 remote debugger API (in fact,
node-inspector requires you to use Chrome or Opera, because it
depends on the Blink rendering engine). It still has some of the same
weirdness about setting breakpoints as the built-in debugger, but it
has a *much* more interactive UI and is a lot easier to use as an
exploratory tool than the debugger REPL.

NOTE: if, when using the debugger, it appears to hang, things can
often be fixed by simply shift-reloading the debugger's tab in Chrome.
It is sometimes all too easy to scramble the inspector enough that
you'll need to reload.
